**WebGL Terrain Generator**

V Decide how data will be structured
    o glTF is popular file
    o but we just stick with representation using BufferGeometry
V Read vector data from black-white image
V Render mesh using vector data
V Allow mouse rotation and translation on image

- Enable adding file to the rendering process

- Generate noise for roughness
- Allow height data to be manipulated after render (make it accessible)
- Get manipulated height data to change the rendered map mesh
- Configure BufferGeometryLoader (or custom loader) to load the mesh

*Erosion*
- Implement constant Erosion
- Implement random Erosion
- Implement erosion with water droplet
